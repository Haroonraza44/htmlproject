    <h1>The story in the book</h1>
<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
<p> Moley had been staring out of his window for about an hour now. On her desk lying between the copies of <i>Nature</i>, <i>New Scientist</i> and all other scientific journals her work had apperad in was a well thumbed copy of <cite>On The Road</cite>. It has been Molly's favorite book since college, and the longer she spent in these four walls the more she felt she needed to be free.</p>
<p>She had spent the last ten years in this room sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote proclaiming that  <q>Work is the refuge of people who have nothing better to do</q>. Althoug many considered her pioneering work, unravelling the secrets of llama <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr>, to be an outstanding acheivement, Molly <em>did</em> think she had something better to do.</p>
